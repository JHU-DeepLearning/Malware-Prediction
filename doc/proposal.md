#### Problem Statement

1. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.

2. The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.

   

#### Dataset

| train.csv     | test.csv      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 83 columns    | 82 columns    |
| 8921484 lines | 7853254 lines |

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a **MachineIdentifier. ** 

**HasDetections** is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. 

Using the information and labels in **train.csv** to predict the value for **HasDetections** for each machine in **test.csv**.

Example: 

one line in **train.csv:**

#### Literature Review

1. Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge in the Cloud [https://sergiosonline.github.io/files/ML_in_the_Cloud-Final-20190630.pdf]

2. Machine Learning to Predict the Likelihood of a Personal Computer to Be Infected with Malware [https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1111&context=datasciencereview]

   

#### Proposed Approach

Since the competition ended in a fairly short time, nearly all teams used Light BGM as the basic model, few teams used deep neural networks, but ended up dropping out the deep learning part. We found that a number of teams pointed out deep neural networks are important future works on this topic.

Also, this dataset is quite similar to recommendation system, thus we propose the study to follow these steps:

1. Dataset investigation/filtering and feature engineering.
2. Reproduction of previous result using light GBM.
3. DNN based methods.
4. Using common recommendation architectures like Wide&Deep, DeepFM.



#### Expected Results

1. Deep neural networks approach that is lacked in most studies. 

2. Comparatable AUC to state of the art studies: ~0.6+
