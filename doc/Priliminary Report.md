### Project Proposal

##### Problem Statement and Proposed Approach

The goal of this project is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The dataset provided by Microsoft provided 8 millions of machine properties and their infection status. During the Kaggle competition, most team used Light GBM as regression model, and extends that deep neural models are important future work on this topic. Thus, we propose to combine light GBM and deep neural networks on this specific task, and aims to generate state of the art results on malware prediction, to help users avoid specific windows setting.

##### Dataset

|    train.csv    |    test.csv     |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
|   83 columns    |   82 columns    |
| 8,921,484 lines | 7,853,254 lines |



### Initial Results

We have trained two baseline models, respectively using LightGBM and 5-layer basic FC Neural Network. Due to memory limitation and time limitation, the preliminary experiment is conducted on a subset of the entire dataset (500,000 out of 8,921,484).

|     Result     | LightGBM | Basic Neural Network |
| :------------: | :------: | :------------------: |
| validation AUC |  0.676   |        0.687         |
|    test AUC    |  0.606   |        0.612         |
