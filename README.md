# CS 482/682 Machine Learning: Deep Learning Final Project

### Deep Learning Based Windows Malware Prediction



This is the code repo for CS 482/682 Machine Learning: Deep Learning Final Project.



This repo contains three models:

1. **dense_model.py**: Dense network as baseline, referred as model 1 in report.

2. **embedding_model.py**: Embedding model with grouping features, referred as model 2 in report.

3. **lightGBM_model.py**: LightGBM model, referred as model 3 in report.

   

Three functional files:

1. **utils.py**: common functions used in each model.
2. **encode_patterns.py**: On dealing with different features, we use different encoding patterns, this contains all the groups.
3. **data_analysis_and_plot.py**:  Exploratory data analysis and plot all the feature correlations.
